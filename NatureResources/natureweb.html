<h2 class="head"> Volcanic Eruption </h2>
<img src="nature15.jpg" class="float" alt="nature">
<p> A volcanic eruption occurs when hot materials are thrown out of a volcano. Lava, rocks, dust, ash and gas compounds are some of these "ejecta".
    Eruptions can come from side branches or from the top of the volcano. Some eruptions are terrible explosions that throws out huge amounts of rock and ash and kill many people. </p>
<h3 class="smallhead"> Effect of Volcanic Eruption </h3>
<p> Volcanic eruptions can cause earthquakes. fast floods, mud slides, and rock falls. Lava can travel very far and burn, bury, or damage anything in its path, including people, houses, and trees. The large amount of dust and ash can cause roofs to fall, makes it hard to breathe, and is normally very smelly. The ground around the volcano is not secure and can cause big earthquakes. </p>

<h2 class="head"> Groundwater </h2>
<img src="nature12.gif" class="float" alt="nature">
<p> Groundwater is the water present beneath Earth's surface in soil pore spaces and in the fractures of rock formations. A unit of rock or an unconsolidated deposite is called an aquifer when it can yeild a usable quantity of water.
    Groundwater is also often withdrawn for agricultural, municipal, and industrial use by constructing and operating extraction wells. </p>
<h3 class="smallhead"> Groundwater Pollution </h3>	
<p> Groundwater is also one of our most important sources of water for irrigation. Unfornately, ground water is susception to pollutants. Groundwater contamination occurs when man-made porducts such as gasoline, oil, road salts and chemicals get into the groundwater and cause it to become unsafe and unfit for human use. </p>
<h3 class="smallhead"> Effect of Groundwater Pollution </h3>
<p> The effects of groundwater pollution are wide. Human infectious disease is one of the more serious effects of groundwater pollution especially in rural countries that are still developing and where sanitation is rarely present. This alone could cause hundreds of thousands of scilness in the ara contaminated. </p>

<h2 class="head"> Landslide </h2>
<img src="nature9.jpeg" class="float" alt="nature">
<p> A landslide is the movement of rock, debris or earth down a slope.They result from the failure of the materials which make up the hill slope and are driven by the force of gravity. Landslides are known also as landslips, slumps or slope failure. </p>
<p> Landslides can be triggered by natural causes or by human activity. They range from a single boulder in a rock fall or topple to tens of millions of cubic metres of material in a debris flow. </p>
<p> The causes of landslides are usually related to instabilities in slopes. It is usually possible to indentify one or more landslide causes and one landslide trigger. The landslide causes are the reasons that a landslide occured in that location and at that time. </p>
<h3 class="smallhead"> Effect of Landslide </h3>
<p> Landslides cause property damage, injury and dealth and adversely affect a variety of resources. For example, water supplies, fisheries, sewage disposal systems, forests, dams and roadways can be affected for years after a slide event. </p>

<h2 class="head"> Flooding </h2>
<img src="nature7.jpg" class="float" alt="nature">
<p> Flooding is extremely dangerous and has the potential to wipe away an entrie city, coastline or area, and cause extensive damage to life and property. It also has great erosive power and can be extremely destructive, even if it is a foot high. </p>
<p> Rivers can overflow their banks to cause flooding. This happens when there is more water upstream than usual, and as it flows downstream to the adjacent low-lying areas(also called a floodplain), there is a burst and water gets into the land. And then, in many cold regions heavy snow over the winter usually stays un-melted for sometimes. There are also mountains that have ice on top them.
 Sometimes the ice suddenly melts when the temperature rises, resulting in massive movement of water into places that are ususlly dry. This is usually dry. This is usually called a snowmelt flood. </p>
 <h3 class="smallhead"> Effect of Flooding </h3>
 <p> Floods can have devastating consequences and can have effects on the economy, environment and people. During floods, roads, bridges, farms, houses and automobiles are destroyed. People become homeless. Many people and animals have died in flash floods. The environment suffers when floods happen. Chemicals and other hazardous substances end up in the water and eventually contaminate the water bodies that floods end up in. </p>

 <h2 class="head"> Glaciers </h2>
 <img src="nature3.jpg" class="float" alt="nature">
 <p> Glaciers are made up of fallen snow that, over many years, compress into large, thickened ice masses. Glaciers form when snow remains in one location long enuogh to tranform into ice. </p>
 <p> In comparison to anthropogenic warming caused carbon dioxide emissions, variations in solar radiation and the effects of volcanic eruptions, which can lower temperatures by blocking solar radiation, now play only a minor role in influencing whether a glacier receds or expands, the scientists found. </p>
 <h3 class="smallhead"> Effect of Glacier melting </h3>
 <p> The melting fresh water from glaciers alters the ocean, not only by directly contributing to the global sea level rise, but also because it pushes down the heavier salt water, thereby changing what scientists call the THC, or Thermo(heat) Haline(salt) Circulation, meaning currents in the ocean. </p>

 <h2 class="head"> River Bank Erosion </h2>
 <img src="nature21.jpg" class="float" alt="nature">
 <p> River Bank Erosion is the wearing away of the banks of a stream or river. This is distinguished from erosion of the bed of the watercourse, which is referred to as scour. The roots of trees growing by a stream are undercuted by such erosion. As the roots bind the soil tightly, they from abutments which just out over the water. These have a significant effect upon the rate and progress of the erosion. </p>
