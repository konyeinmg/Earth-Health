<img src="nature11.jpg" class="right" alt="nature">
<p> Use Native plants in your landscape. They look great and don't need much water or fertilizer. And then Reduce chemicals around your home and yard and make sure to dipose of them properly-don't dump them on the ground! Shut off the water when you brush your teeth or shaving and don't let it run while waiting for it to get cold. 
Reduce the amount of "stuff" you use and reuse what you can. Recycle paper, plastic, cardboard, glass, aluminium and other materials. </p>

<p> We can do the method ourselves by planting a groundcover on hire and trees as possible as we can. A solid, well-designed retaining should be made of sturdy materials such as masonry, brick, stone, or steel. Drainage materials behind the wall help increase the stability of the wall. For temporary landslide preventation, sandbags can be used to divert water from uncontrolled spilling just as retaining walls or diverted pathways do. </p>
