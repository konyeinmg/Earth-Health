    <div class="par"><dt> Capt Paul Watson <br> Marine activist </dt>
	<img src="org11.jpg" class="right" alt="organization">
	<dd> Paul Watson, 57, is the man Japanese whalers, Canadian seal hunters and illegal fisherman everywhere fear the most. The ultimate direct action man, he co-founded Greenpeace in the 70s and now has two boats that patrol the world's oceans and confront anyone he has evidence of acting criminally. Now he is opening up 
	a new role for envrionment group. The idea of environmental activists becoming a new green police force may developing in years to come. </dd>

	<div class="par"><dt> Vicki Buck <br> Entrepreneur </dt>
	<img src="org13.jpg" class="right" alt="organization">
	<dd> As the world scrambles to find a fuel supply that doesn't exacerbate global warming, New Zealander Vicki Buck, 51, has emerged as the acceptable face of biofuels. She is one-third of Aquaflow, a small company that was one of the first to crack the technology needed to harvest wild algae from sewage ponds, then extract fuel from its suitable for cars and aircraft. </dd>
	</div><hr>
	<div class="par"><dt> Angela Merkel <br> German Chancellor </dt>
	<img src="org14.jpg" class="right" alt="organization">
	<dd> Angela Merkel, 53, has inherited Tony Blair's mantle as the politician forcing climate change that hardest on to the world stage, and she is a formidable advocate. The only major player left who helped hammer out the original global warming agreement at Kyoto in 1997, she is one of the very few with a grasp of what it means of humanity fails. The speed at which Germany under Merkel is pursuing
	climate change policies is embarrasing the UK and other countries, which talk up the need for action, but deliver little. "The faster industrialised countries cut their emissions, the more willing other countries will be to do theire bit" Merkel says. </dd>

	<div class="par"><dt> Bob Hertzberg <br> Financier </dt>
	<img src="org15.jpg" class="right" alt="organization">
	<dd> Bob Hertzberg, 53, founder of venture capital firm Renewable Capital, is one of a new breed of financier piling unprecedented amounts of money into renewable technologies. He ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, finishing in third place. </dd>

	<div class="par"><dt> Gavin Schmidt <br> Climatologist </dt>
	<img src="org12.jpg" class="right" alt="organization">
    <dd> Gavin Schmidt, 38 and British, is a climate modeller at the Nasa Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. He founded <a href="http:">RealClimate.org</a> with collegues in 2004. Offering "climate science from climate scientists," the site has quickly become a must-read for interested amateurs, and a perfect foil to both the climate sceptic misinformation that saturates sections of the Web and the overexcitement of the claims of some environmentalists. </dd>
