Do you think keeping Earth "clean and green" is important?</h1>
<p><b><i>In this page, you will find ways to protect Earth and preserve the environment.
Try to leave the Earth a better place than you arrived.
Too much emission of carbon dioxide is one of the environmental issues we are facing today.We all can make some changes in our
daily lives to live in a greener,more sustainable way.Let's spread the world to go green.

<h2>What is carbon dioxide?</h2>

<p><b> &nbsp; &nbsp; Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas.Greenhouse gases play an important role in helping the earth 
trap and retain heat for life as we know it, however, an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide
in our atmosphere could lead to overall warming of our climate. And harmful carbon dioxide(CO2)
greenhouse gas emissions damage the environment.</b></p>
<h2>So what are the main source of carbon dioxide?</h2>
<a href="Screenshot (2).png"><img src="Screenshot (2).png" alt="Carbon dioxide" width="300" height="189"></a>
We are living in the best of times and in the worst times.
Since the Industrial Revolution, human sources of carbon dioxide emissions have been growing.Human activities such as the 
burning of oil, coal and gas, as well as deforestation are the primary cause of the increased carbon dioxide concentration in 
atmosphere.The largest source of carbon dioxide emission is from combustion of fossil fuels. This produce 87% of human carbon
dioxide emmissions.The remainder results from the clearing of forest and other land use changes(9%) as well as some industrial
process such as cement manufacturing(4%).Of all the different types of fossil fuels,coal produces the most carbon dioxide.Due 
to human activities, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has been rising extensively since the Industrial  
Revolution and has now reached dangerous levels not seen in the last 3 million years.<br><br>

The transporation sector is the second largest source of athropogenic carbon dioxide emissons.
Our personal vehicles are a major cause of global warming. Collectively, cars and trucks account for nearly one-fifth of all 
US emissions, emitting around 24 pounds of carbon dioxide and other global-warming gases for every gallon of gas. About five 
pounds comes from the extraction, production, and delivery of the fuel, while the great bulk of heat-trapping emissions and 
more than 19 pounds per galloncomes right out of a car's tailpipe.In total, the US transportation sector,which includes cars,
 trucks, planes, trains, ships, and freight and produces nearly thirty percent of all US carbon dioxide emissions, more than
 almost any other sector.<br><br>

<p style="text-indent: 3em" ><b>The important source of carbon dioxide is plant and animal respiration,which accounts for 28.56% of natural emissions.
Most of the CO<sub>2</sub> released from the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities (e.g., cement manufacturing) is stored 
either in the atmosphere or in the oceans. The CO<sub>2</sub> that remains in the atmosphere acts as a greenhouse gas, absorbing 
long-wavelength radiation (heat) in the atmosphere. CO<sub>2</sub> taken up by the oceans does not affect the Earth's heat balance, 
so an understanding of the air-sea exchange of CO<sub>2</sub> is an essential part of understanding the Earth's climate system and the
potential impact of future CO<sub>2</sub>emissions.Cement production produces the most amount of carbon dioxide amongst all industrial 
process.Steel production is another industrial process that is an important source of carbon dioxide.The largest natural 
source of carbon dioxide emissions is from ocean atmosphere exchange.This produces 42.84% of natural carbon dioxide emissions.
