<h1><img src="qustn1.png" alt="Question" width="140" height="98">How can we reduce carbon emissions?</h1>
<p>There are three primary methods for reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: employing energy efficiency and 
conservation practices; using carbon-free or reduced-carbon energy resources; and capturing and storing carbon either from fossil
fuels or from the atmosphere.
Carbon is present throughout the natural environment in many forms. Carbon is present in the air as carbon dioxide, and contributes 
to the "Greenhouse Effect" and global warming. Efforts are being made to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere 
to counter this effect.</p>
<h2>Reduce Your Carbon Emissions From Driving</h2>
<b>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
Alternatives to driving. When possible, walk or ride your bike in order to avoid carbon emissions completely. Carpooling and public 
transportation drastically reduce CO2 emissions by spreading them out over many riders.</li><br>
<li>Driving style. Speeding and unnecessary acceleration reduce mileage by up to 33%, waste gas and money, and increase your 
carbon emissions.</li>
</ul></td>

<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Drive a fuel efficient vehicle. All vehicles have an estimated miles-per-gallon rating. Electric cars still have carbon emissions because they're 
usually charged with electricity created by the burning of fossil fuels; however, their MPG equivalents (MPGe's) are typically much higher than conventional
and hybrid cars. In some situations, electric cars like the Nissan Leaf are essentially free.</li>

<h2>Reduce Your Carbon Emissions From Air Travel</h2>
<ul>
<li>General. Until petroleum-based aviation fuel is replaced, you should avoid flying when possible, fly less frequently, fly shorter distances, and fly economy class.</li><br>
<li>Leisure Air Travel. Take fewer and longer vacations that are far away, and more frequent and driveable "staycations" closer to home.</li><br>
<li>Don't fly on private jets. Fly first or business class if you must, because at least those seats always fill up anyway, and avoid private jets, including services like NetJets and XOJET.</li><br>

<h2>Reduce Your Home Energy Carbon Emissions</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
Insulate and seal your home. Reduce drafts and air leaks with caulk, insulation, and weather stripping. Many states offer
programs and incentives to facilitate this, and a great example is Energy Upgrade California.</li><br>
<li>Lighting. Turn off lights you're not using and when you leave the room. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact 
flourescent or LED ones.</li>
</ul></td>
<td><img src="lght1.jpg" alt="Light" width="300" height="189"></a></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Solar. Add solar panels to the roof of your home. This costs a little more than the above options, but many providers 
offer financing options which minimize upfront costs. Two examples are SolarCity and SunRun.</li>

<h2>Other Ways to Reduce Your Carbon Emissions</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
Water usage. Lower the amount of energy used to pump, treat, and heat water by washing your car less often, using 
climate-appropriate plants in your garden, installing drip irrigation so that plants receive only what they need, and making 
water-efficient choices when purchasing shower heads, faucet heads, toilets, dishwashers and washing machines.</li>
</ul></td>

</tr>

<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Food. It has been estimated that 13% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the production and transport of food. Buy
local and eat a more diversified diet including less meat and dairy to reduce your carbon emissions resulting from the use of
fossil fuel-based fertilizers, pesticides, and gas required to produce and transport of the food you eat.</li>
</td>
<td><img src="fd1.jpg" alt="Food" width="300" height="189"></a></td>

<tr><td>
<ul>
<li>Reuse and recycle.  It has been estimated that 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the "provision of goods,"
which means the extraction of resources, manufacturing, transport, and final disposal of "goods" which include consumer products
and packaging, building components, and passenger vehicles, but excluding food. By buying used products and reselling or recyling 
items you no longer use, you dramatically reduce your carbon emissions from the "provision of goods."</li>
