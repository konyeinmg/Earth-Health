<h1>Why are Forests Important?</h1>
<p>Forests are the essential for the sustainability of planet earth. Forests play a fundamental role in combating rural poverty,ensuring food security and providing
people with livehoods. They deliever vital enviromental services such as clean air and water, the conservation of biodiversity and combating climate change. Forests are
very important and grow in many places around the world.  They are fundamental life forms and provide for the continuity of the world's biodivesity, livehood,
and environmental adaptive responses.</p><br>


There are many reasons why forests are an important feature for the environment and in our daily lives.

<p>Deforestation is the cutting down of trees in a large area,the destruction of forests by people, destroying large areas of tropical rainforests.
Myanmar is the third highest deforestation rate in Asia, it was so obvious that polices and laws on enviromental conservation were weak.
Due to rapid deforestation, the country faced its severest weather conditions in 2015 and 2016.</p>

<h1>Causes And Effects Of Deforestation In Myanmar Environmental Sciences</h1>
<h2>Causes of deforestation</h2>

<p>The meaning of deforestation is cutting, clearing and removing of trees for various reasons such as logging, slashing-and-burning agriculture,
clearing land for livestock, building dam.  Sometimes, natural disatsters can extremely destruct forests.  For instance, Cyclone Nargis destroyed
a lot of trees in Myanmar on 2 and 3 May 2008.  Deforestation can be caused not only human activities, but also natural disasters.</p><br>

<p>In Myanmar, government exports a lot of natural resources to other countries, but they got more money by exporting timber.  According to the 
parlimentary Natural Resources and Environment Conversation Committee, Myanmar exports a lot of teaks by legal or illegal.  Myanmar exported 1.6 million
tones of teak per annually to neighbouring countries such as India, China, Bangladesh, Thailand and Malysia.  According to statistics, Myanmar has 
more than 16.32 million hectares of forest, and the area of teak is 24,300 hectares while the area of hardwood is 324,000 hectares.  Almost 
1.98 million cubic meters of hardwood and 283,000 cubic meters of teak are used in Myanmar per annual.  As a result, cutting a lot of trees for 
exporting is treatening Myanmar forests.</p>
<p>Overpopulation affect on forests because they destroy a lot of trees for their profit.  In Myanmar, forest fire is one of the main problems to destory forests.
Myanmar lost up to 10 tons of forest fuel because of forest fire. As a result, every 30 to 70 tons of top forest soil are destryed in Myanmar.  Myanmar is 
facing natural disasters such as cyclones, landslides, earthquakes, tsunami, fire and drought.  They are also real threats to Myanmar's environment.</p>

</table><br>

We  can deduce the massive effects of deforestation and tree-cutting activities.  Let us see a few below:

<ul>
<li>Soil erosion destruction</li>
<div>In Myanmar, soil erosion is one of the most serious problems, so the agricultural products of Myanmar are falling.
Soils are exposed to the sun's heat.  Soil moisture is dried up, nutrients evaporate and bacteria that help break down organic matter are affected. 
Eventually, rain washes down the soil surfaces and erosion takes place.  Soils never get their full potential back.  If soil erosion cannot be preserved, 
it will lead to flooding.</div>
<li>Water Cycle</li>
<div>When forests are destroyed, the atmosphere, water bodies and the water table are all affected.  Trees absorb and retain water in their roots.  A large
part of the water that ciuculates in the ecosystem of rainforests remains inside the plants.  Some of this moisture is transpired into the atmosphere.  When
this process is broken, the atmosphere and water bodies begin to dry out.  The watershed potential is compromised and less water will run through the rivers.</div>
<li>Loss of Biodiversity</li>
<div>Many wonderful species of plants and animals have been lost, and many others remain endangered.  More than 80% of the world's species remain in the
Tropical Rainforest.  It is estimated that about 50 to 100 species of animals are being lost each day as a result of destruction of their habitats, and that 
is a tragedly.</div>
<li>Climate Change</li>
<div>Plant absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> (a greenhouse gas)from the atmosphere and uses it to produce food.  In return, it gives off Oxygen.  Destroying the forests means CO<sub>2</sub>
will remain in the atmosphere and in addition, destroyed vegetation will give off more CO<sub>2</sub> stored in them as they decompose.This will alter the climate of 
that region.  Cool climate may get a lot hotter and hot places may get a lot cooler.</div>
</ul>

Deforesatition occurs when forest land is cleared, usually to harvest the timber or clear space for agricultural operations.
More than 25 percent of the land on Earth is covered by forests, but millions of hectares of ecosystem are destroyed every year.
Over half of the world's forests are found in just seven countries, Brazil, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Russia, and the 
United States.  Therefore, while the disadvantages of deforestation are felt on a global scale, the decision to clear forest land belongs to only a 
handful of governments.  Deforestation threatens future scientic discoveries of species that could be useful to mankind.

<h1>Forest Degradation</h1>

<p>Forest degradation is different from deforestation. Degradation is used to mean the destruction or reduction in quality of specific aspects of forests.  It can
result in a decrease in tree cover, changes in their structure or a reduction in the number of species that can be found there.  If acid rain destroy trees in a
vast area, it can be called forest degradation.</p><br><br>

<p>Mangroves are a community of tropical trees that have adapted to a salt-water environment.  Mangroves play a critical role as part of the
interdependent coral reef ecosystem.  This type of ecosystem is found exclusively in tropical and subtropical regions of the planet.</p>
<h1>Mangrove Deforestation in Myanmar</h1>
<img class="float" src="aa.png" alt="Forests" width="300" height="730">
<p>Mangrove Deforestation in Myanmar is the clearing of mangrove forests, usually for commercial uses or resources extraction, which is occuring mainly
in 3 different regions: Rakhine State, Ayeyarwaddy Mega Delta, and Tanintharyi Division.  The mangrove forests in Ayeyarwaddy Mega Delta are the largest
but are also the most affected by human actions.  There are also natural threats that contribute to mangrove deforestation such as soil erosion.  There has been recent increased attention to conserve and restore these forests through rehablilitation projects and
policies.  These mangrove forests are very important to the country's economy, climate and biodiversity.</p><br><br>
<h1>Importance of Mangrove Forests</h1>
<p>Mangrove forests play a major role in Myanmar's economy since it provides natural resources for both personal and commercial uses.  They ameliorate the
negative impacts of natural disasters such as cyclones and storms by stabilizing shorelines.  They also provide other climate benefits.  They create protected 
zones where young fish and other marine life can grow and thrive.  They also protect coastal communities from flooding during storm surges.  Mangrove forests
also greatly contribute to ameliorating global warming because they are carbon dense and they recycle greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide into oxygen, which is beneficial
for humans and other living creatures.</p><br>
