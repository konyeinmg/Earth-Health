<h1>Why save the forests?</h1>
<p>We should save forests as a protection against floods and famines.  Forests prevent floods and reduce soil erosion by regulating the flow of water.  
Adequate forest cover also ensures a sustainable and safe environment.  Forest helps in increasing the humidity of the air and cause greater rainfall.  They 
also help in increasing the soil fertility.  They protect the adjoining crops by reducing the velociy of the storms.</p>

<h2>What can I do help preserve our forests?</h2>
<p>There are millions of people who are learning about the issues and taking little steps to help. But, it is that saving forests is not going to be easy.  It will take the
efforts of many people working together.  Additionally, many governments, organizations, and societies are making great strides in helping reducing deforestation and 
encouraging forest plantations.  But there is still a lot to do.</p>

<p>Due to the extent and nature of forest destruction, efforts to stop deforestation and preserve them are best achieved at government and organization levels.  
This means that laws, rules, and regulations from countries can help to enforce the preservation of forests.  Laws on farming, timber, and wood, as well as land 
use must be encouraged and enforced.
We can save forests stopping the cutting of trees (stop deforestation), establishing new forests (afforestation) and restablishing old forests (reforestation).
Planting new trees can help to reduce the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air.  Reforestation can help to restore what the erosion has damaged.  It can also help to 
supply jobs for those who lack skills to be employed in other industries.</p>

Here are a few things you can also do to help:
<img class="float" src="1.jpg" alt="Forests" width="330" height="280">
<ul>
<li>Make a conscious effort to share information with others (friends at school or university and family members) on deforestation and its' effects.</li>
<li>Join organizations, forest-preservation societies and pressure groups that aim to help preserve the rest of our natural resources.  When more people work
together, the impact is greater.</li>
<li>Reduce the use of artificial items, recycle more and reuse items.  Wood, paper, plastics and many other things we use every day at home can be linked to 
natural resources being destroyed.  This means that if we all recycle more, there will be less dependence on the environment and trees.  It also means that
companies and governments will import less raw-materials from the forest regions of the world.</li></div>

There is a fun way to remember the most important points in forest preservation called TREES which means....
<div>
<ul>
<li>Teach others about the importance of the environment and how they can help save rainforests.</li>
<li>Restore damaged ecosystems by planting trees on land where forests have been cut down.</li>
<li>Encourage people to live in a way that doesn't hurt the environment.</li>
<li>Establish parks to protect rainforests and wildlife.</li>
<li>Support companies that operate in ways that minimize damage to the environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Protecting Our Forests Protecting Our Future</h2>
<p>Protecting the world's forests is a key priority in the fight against climate change. Maintaining the forest ecosystems for the benifit of futute 
generations. Therefore, we should protect our forests as much as we can.</p>
