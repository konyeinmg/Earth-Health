<h1 style="color:purple">Top 10 Conutries with Strong Environmental Democracy Laws</h1>
<h2>10 Best Countries for Environmental Democracy</h2>
<p style="text-indent:3em">The environment and human well-being are inextricably linked. When governments, businesses and others make decisions about land and natural resources, they inevitably impact the health, livelihoods and quality-of-life of local communities. So it stands to reason that the public should have a right to be involved in the environmental decision-making-specifically, to know what is at stake, to participate in the decision itself and to have the ability to challenge decisions that disregard human rights or harm ecosystems.
The top countries with strong national laws for environmental democracy
The top three countries are all former Soviet states - Lithuania, Latvia and Russia. Many of their relevant national laws were enacted as part of democratization reforms in the 1990s and the <abbr title="United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's ">UNECE</abbr> legally binding Aarthus Convention on access to information, public participation and access to justice in environmental matters. Lithuania and Latvia have both ratified this convention and strengthened their legislation after doing so, such as Lithuania's amendments to its Law on Environmental Protection and Latvia's passage of its Environmental Protection Law.</p>

<h1 style="color: #660000;">Lowest-Scoring Countries for Environmental Democracy Laws</h1>
<p style="text-indent:3em">Many of the bottom performers also lacked requirements on collecting environmental information and monitoring compliance. National governments in Ethiopia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Bangladesh and Thailand do not actually ensure that factories, mines and other facilities aren't harming people or the planet. And requirements for public participation in these countries are almost always limited to environmental impact assessments, leaving out other important decisions such as the development of forest management plans, protected area policies or environmental protection laws.</p>
