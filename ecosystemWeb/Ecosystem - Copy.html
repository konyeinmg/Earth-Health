<h3> Definition of Ecosystem </h3>
<p> An ecosystem is a community of living organisms in conjuction with the nonliving components of their environment(things like air, water,and mineral soil),interacting 
as a system.Energy, water, nitrogen and soil minerals are other essential abiotic components of an ecosystem.</p>
<img src="eco3.jpg" alt="ecosystem"><br>
<h3> Examples of ecosystem </h3>
<p> Examples of ecosystem are: agroecosystem, aquatic ecosystem, coral reef, desert, forest, human ecosystem, littoral zone, marine ecosystem, prairie, rainforest, savanna, steppe, taiga, tundra, urban ecosystem and others.</p><br> 
<h3> How ecosystem is processig? </h3>
<p> Ecosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors.External factors,also called state factors,control the overfall structure of an ecosystem and the way things
    work within it,but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem.The most important of these is climate.Climate determines the biome in which the ecosystem is embedded.
    Rainfall patterns and temperatures seasonlity determine the amount of water available to the ecosystem and supply of energy available(by influencing photosynthesis).
    Parent material,the underlying geological material that gives rise to soils,determines the nature of the soils present,and influences the supply of mineral nutrients.Topography also
    controls ecosystem processess by affecting like microclimate, soil development and movement of water through a system.This may be the difference between the ecosystem present in 
    wetland situated in a small depression on the landspace and one present an adjcent steep hillslide.</p><br>
<h3> What is our ecosystem happening? </h3>
<p> Humans destroy ecosystems.Our lifestyle creates pollution and we overuse our natural resources. Today we are using the resources of 1 and 1/2 planet Earths,even though we only have one. 
    We build roads, hunt animals, cut down trees destroying forests and just litter the planet like crzy. We wastes resources that are not infinite and will soon run out, if we continue our practice.</p><br>
<h3> Ecosystems have been changed? </h3>
<p> Virtually all of Earth's ecosystems have been significally transformed through human actions. In the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century ecosystems changed more rapidly than at any
    other time in recorded human history. Some of most significant changes have been the conversion of forests and grasslands into cropland, the diversion and stroagee of freshwater behind dams, and the loss of mangrove and coral reef areas. 
    The most rapid changes are now taking place in developing countries, but industrial countries experienced comparable changes in the past. </p><br>
<h3> Environmental components of ecosystem </h3>
<dl>
   <dt> Soil </dt>
   <dd> Soil is a critial part of an ecosystem. It provides important nutrients for the plants. It helps anchor the plants to keep them in place. Soil absorbs and holds water for plants and animals to use and provides a home for lots of living organisms.</dd>
   <dt> Air </dt>
   <dd> The atmosphere provides oxygen and carbon dioxide for the plants and animals in an ecosystem. The atmosphere is also part water cycle. Without the complex interactions and elements in the atmosphere, there would be no life at all! </dd>
   <dt> The Sun </dt>
   <dd> The heat and light from the sun are critical parts of an ecosystem. The sun's heat helps water evaporate and return to the atomsphere where it is cycled back into water. The heat also keeps plants and animals warm. The light from the sun is necessary for photosynthesis, so that plants have the energy they need to make food.</dd>
   <dt> Water </dt>
   <dd> Without water there would be no life. Water is a large percentage of the cells that make up all living organisms. Without water all life would die. Water is also used by plants to carry and distribute the nutrients they need to survive. </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Water &amp; Ecosystem </h3>
<dl>
    <dt> <h4>Water Cycle</h4> </dt>
	<dd> Water is essential for life. No organism can survive without water. Preciptation (rain, snow, slush dew etc.) is the only source of water on the earth. Water received from the atmosphere on the earth returns back to the atmosphere as water vapour resulting from direct evaporation and through evaporation the continuous movement of water in the biosphere is called water cycle (hydrological cycle). 
	     Water is not evenly distrubuted through the surface of the earth. Almost 95% 0f the water on the earth is chemically bound to rocks and does not cycle. Out of the remaining 5%, nearly 97.3% is in the oceans and 2.1% exists as polar ice caps. Thus only 0.6% is present ass fresh water in the form of atmospheric water vapours, ground and soil water. Evaporatin and precipitation are two main processes 
		 involved in water cycle. These two processes alternate with each other. Water from oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams evaporates by sun's energy. Plants also transpire huge of amounts of water. Water remains in the vapour state in air and forms clouds which drift with wind. Clouds meet with the cold air in the mountainous regions above the forests and condense to form rain precipitate which comes down due to gravity. </dd>
	<dt> <h4>Effect of Water Pollution on the ecosystem</h4> </dt>
	<dd> Water pollution can come as a result of natural or unnatural compounds being added to a watersource. These can sway the balance of an ecosystem resulting in danger to natural wildlife of aquatic environments.<p> Some animals and plants are highly susceptible to the effects of water pollution.</p>
	<ul>
	    <li> Amphibians tend to be very pollution sensitive due to the fact that they absorb chemicals in the water through their skins; this is one reason why many amphibian populations are in distress today.</li>
		<li> With addition of detergents to the ecosystem, insects that normally have the ability to walk on water will be unable to. </li>
		<li> Younger animals also have a greater sensitivity to chemical compounds, especially those that mimic organic compounds, since they are still undergoing the physiological changes associated with maturation. These effects can range from physiological effects such as suffocation and thinning of eggshells to the alteration of neurochemistry. </li>
	</ul>
    </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Effect of Air Pollution on the Ecosystem </h3>
<p> The interactions between air pollution and ecosystem services is very important. The air pollutants are ozone(O<sub>3</sub>), nitrogen oxides(NO<sub>x</sub>), ammonia(NH<sub>3</sub>) and sulphur dioxide(SO<sub>2</sub>). 
<dl>
    <dt> Ozone(O<sub>3</sub>) </dt>
	<dd> Ozone is secondary pollutant, formed from the precursors nitrogen oxidesnitrogen oxides(NO<sub>x</sub>) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including methane. At present ecosystems, particularly forest ecosytems, act as a net sink of ozone. Ozone is also of great importance for climate regulation. In addition to its role ass a greenhouse gas, ozone may also have large effects on climate regulation services in terrestrial ecosystems. </dd>
	<dt> Nitrogen oxides(NO<sub>x</sub>) </dt>
	<dd> Deposition nitrogen oxides can have a fetilisation effect in N-limited ecosystems but deposition effects are largely deleterious to provisioning services. It can also cause the reduction of biodiversity in sensitive ecosystems through acidification and eutrophication. There are also effects on aquatic ecosystems from both direct deposition and leaching from soils which can reduce water quality and the harvesting of food. Atmospheric concentrations of nitrogen oxides are linked to climate regulation due to its role as a precursor of ozone. </dd>
	<dt> Ammonia(NH<sub>3</sub>) </dt>
	<dd> Ammonia can have significant effects on a large range of sensitive ecosystems throung both increased nitrogen deposition and acidification. Emissions of ammonia affect services in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems (through direct deposition and leaching from surrounding areas.) It is also likely that any climate benefit from increased carbon sequestration will be balanced by greater nitrous oxide production in soils. Furthermore, there may be adverse effects on ecosystem goods, such as increased plant susceptibility to stress, close to large point sources for very sensitive systems.</dd>
	<dt> Sulphur dioxide(SO<sub>2</sub>) </dt>
	<dd> Sulphur fertilisation can be seen in cultivated ecosystems. This effect is limited to North America and Western Europe. Acidification is another major impact of sulphur deposition in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. </dd>

<h3> Forests &amp; Ecosystem </h3>
<h3> Importance of Forests for Ecosystem </h3>
<p> Trees are important to the ecosystem for several reasons. Without trees, human life could not exist on Earth. According to the Community of Forest Guidebook, 100 trees remove about five tons of CO<sub>2</sub> and 1000 pounds of other pollutants within their lifetime. CO<sub>2</sub> is toxic to the human body so it is important for trees to remove it. 
    The pollutants that 100 trees remove in their lifetime also include 400 pounds of ozone and 300 pounds of particulates. This is crucial for those people who suffer from respriatory disease. We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use. Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection,
	prevent soil erosion ans mitigate climate change. Yet, despite our dependence on forests, we are still allowing them to disappear. </p>
<h4> Forest Services </h4>
<p> After oceans, forests are the world's largest storehouses of carbon. They provide ecosystem services that are critical to human welfare. These include: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Absorbing harmful greenhouse glasses that produce climate change. In tropical foressts alone, a quarter of a trillion tons of carbons is stored in above below ground biomass. </li>
	<li> Providing clean  water for drinking, bathing and other household needs </li>
	<li> Protecting watersheds and reducing or slowing the amount of erosion and chemicals that reach waterways /li>
	<li> Serving as a buffer in natural disassters like flood and rainfalls </li>
	<li> Providing habitat to more than half of the world's land-based species </li>
</ul>
<h3> Effects of Deforestation on the Ecosystem </h3>
<p> Deforestation is the clearing of forests to obtain lumber and provides space for either agricultural zones or urban development. As a result of massice global urbanization and agricultural development, deforestation is a major factor contributing to climate
    change. Deforestation alters not only nearby ecosystems but also the atmosphere on a global level, with devastating results. </p>
<h4> Component Effects because of Deforestation </h4>
<dl>
    <dt> Water Chemistry </dt>
	<dd> Deforestation also affects nearby rivers, streams, and other water sources as nutrients from the soil are removed through leaching, which happens when water removes soluble nutrients from the soil and carries them elsewhere. </dd>
	<dt> The Atmosphere </dt>
	<dd> Deforestation affects not only a forest and its immediate surroundings but also the atmosphere, which in turns spreads across the biosphere--all the planet's ecosystems and everything in them. As trees are cut down and burnt, the carbon they contain is released into the atmosphere. </dd>
	<dt> Soil Impact </dt>
	<dd> The soil that provides nutrients for vegetation in ecosystems is also affected by deforestation. Soil in deforested areas is exposed to more sunlight, which increases the soil temperature and oxidizes the carbon in the soil to carbon dioxide. Soil erosion tends to be greater in drier, more mountainous areas, where there is less vegatation to prevent the movement of soil and to absorb the nutrients. </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Role of Animals in Ecosystem </h3>
<p> Animals are one component of an ecosystem. Their role as consumers helps maintain the cycle of energy in the environment and ensures the substainability of their habitat. Every little animal within the ecosystem has a vital role in the well-being of the planet. If one species is rendered extinct due to some imbalance, it can have significant cascading effects throughout the rest of the chain. 
    For example even a small bee is in fact a crucial worker in the factory of nature. Another important part of the chain are predators. Carnivores are usually seen as a threat and usually hunted for safety or even sport. Predators are important to ecosystem since they help in keeping other animal populations in check. Some animals work in balance wih one another in the quest for survival. When 
	one of the pair is taken to extinction or their numbers get too low, the other animal population suffers. </p>
<h4> Extinct animals &amp; Ecosystem </h4>
<p> All animal is a part of a complex ecosystem that also our lands and our waters. Remave one or more of those parts and you damage the ecosystems, sometimes beyond restoration. Now, our environment is facing with a problem which can affect the ecosystem. This is "Extinct Wild!". </p>
<p> The top endangered animals are: </p>
<dl>
    <dt> The Vaquita </dt>
    <dd> The world's smallest-and rarest-marine mammal </dd>
	<dt> Amur Leopard </dt>
	<dd> The world's rarest cat: Only 40 left in Russia's Far Fast </dd>
	<dt> Javan Rhinoceros </dt>
	<dd> No more than 60 of these swamp-dwelling Asian rhino exist </dd>
	<dt> Northern Sportive Lemur </dt>
	<dd> Here's the scarcest of Madagascar's fast-dwindling lemur species </dd>
	<dt> Western Lowland Gorilla </dt>
	<dd> Disease and illegal hunting are wiping out this gentle giant </dd>
	<dt> The Saola-An Asian Unicorn </dt>
	<dd> So rare it is almost mythological, the saola hangs on by its hoof tips in a forest full of poacher's snares </dt>
	<dt> Leatherback Sea Turtle </dt>
	<dd> The population of the world's largest turtle is dropping at an alarming rate </dd>
	<dt> The Tiger </dt>
	<dd> The world's biggest cat is almost gone </dd>
	<dt> Chinese Giant Salamander </dt>
	<dd> Humans are eating the world's largest amphibian into extinciton </dd>
	<dt> Ivory-Billed Woodpecker </dt>
	<dd> A bird so rare it may no longer even exist </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Human Interaction on Ecosystem </h3>
<p> Humans interact with the world around us every day, but some of our actions are more harmful than others. As our population approaches 7 billion people, the effects of human activiteis on the ecosystem, 
    including the water, air, land and the life that we share the world with, are almost immerasurable. </p>
<dl><h4> Main Effect of Human Activities on ecosystem </h4>
    <dt> Pollution </dt>
	<dd> Humans pollute the land, water and air with unwanted refuse. Almost 2.4 billion people don't have access to clean water. </dd>
	<dt> Global Warming </dt>
	<dd> Environmental scientists have been warning us for decades that the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that come from burning fossil fuels are affecting the planet's ecosystem. The increase of CO<sub>2</sub> in the 
	     atmosphere traps heat that would otherwise escape into space, increasing the Earth's overall temperature. </dd>
	<dt> Deforestation </dt>
	<dd> For every corn field you see, chances are good there was once a forest in its place. As our population continues to increase, humans create more and larger farms, which means removing the dwindling numbe of forests. </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Effect of Oil pollution on Ecosystem </h3>
<p> When oil is spilled into an aquatic environment, it can harm organisms that live on, around, and under the water surface by both chemical toxicity and by coating and smothering wildlife. This has both short-term and long-term effects on all parts of the marine food web, including long-term damage to breeding and migration habitats that affects future generations of marine life. 
    Short-term effects vary with the type of environment, amount of oil, effect of waves and weather, and type of oil: light, medium or heavy. </p>
<p> And then the loss of predators has a cascade effect on ecosystems and offshore, the most vulnerable species are those found on the sea surface. Since most oils float, the creatures most affected are surface predators, such as sea otters and seabirds.</p>
<p> One of the marine habitats most vulnerable to environment change is the mangrove forest. Oil spills that coat the exposed roots of mangrove trees can plug up the air-breathing pores, or lenticels and suffocate the trees. Mangrove forests and salt marshes provide important habitat for migrating birds, and a nursey area for fish and shrimp. The whole mangrove environment can be killed by an oil spill, with dire consequences, not only to marine life, but to humans living near these protective ecosystems. </p>
<h3> Soil in Environment </h3>
<p> Soil is a mixture of minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids and countless organisms that together support life on Earth. Soil is a nature body called the pedosphere which has four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a mean of water storage, supply and purification; it is a modifier of Earth's atmosphere; it is a habitat for organisms; all of which, in turn, modify the soil. </p>
<p>	Soil has been called the Skin of the Earth as it inerfaces with the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere and the biosphere. Soil consists of a solid phase of minterals and organic matter (the soil matrix), as well as a porous phase that holds gases (the soil atmosphere) and water (the soil solution). Accordingly, soils are often treated as a three-state system of solids, liquids and gases. </p>
<h3> Soil pollution &amp; Environment </h3>
<p> With the rise of concrete buildings and roads, one part of the Earth that we rarely see is the soil. It has many different names, such as dirt, mud and ground. However, it is definitely very important to us. The plants that feed us grow in soil and keeping it healthy is essential to maintaining a beautiful planet. However, like all other forms of nature, soil also suffers from pollution. The pollution of soil is  common thing these days, and it happens due to the presence of man made elements. </p>
<p> The main reasons why the soil becomes contaminated is due to the presence of man made waste. The waste produced from nature itself such as dead plants, carcasses of animals and rotten fruits and vegetables only adds to the fertility of soil. However our waste products are full of chemicals that are not orginally found in nature and lead to soil pollution. </p>
<dl><h4> Mian causes of Soil Pollution </h4>
    <dt> Industrial Activities </dt>
	<dd> The industrial waste lingers in the soil surface for a long time and makes it unsuitable for use. </dd>
	<dt> Agricultural Activities </dt>
	<dd> Chemical utilization has gone up tremendrously since technology provided us with modern pesticides and fertilizers. Chemical damage the compostion of the soil and make it easier to erode by water and air. </dd>
	<dt> Waste Disposal </dt>
	<dd> Evey human produces a certain amount personal waste products by way or urine and feces that is another way in which we are adding to soil pollution. </dd>
	<dt> Accidental Oil Spills </dt>
	<dd> Oil leaks can happen during storage and transport of chemicals. These chemicals can enter into the groundwater throungh soil and make the water undrinkable. </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Agricultural Effects on Our Ecosystem </h3>
<p> Agriculture practices having environmental impacts that affect a wide range of ecosystem services, including water quality, pollination, nutrient cycling, soil retention, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. </p>
<h3> Climate Change Impacts on Ecosystem </h3>
<p> Climate is an important environmental influence on ecosystems. Changing climate affects ecosystems in a variety of ways. For instance, warming may force species to migrate to higher latitudes or higher elevations where temperatures are more conducive to their survival. 
    Similarly, as sea level rises, saltwater intrustion into a freshwater system may force some key species to relocate or die, thus removing predators or prey that are critical in the existing food chain. </p>
<dl>
    <dt> Range Shifts </dt>
	<dd> As temperatures increase, the habitat ranges of many North American species are moving north and to higher elevations. In recent decades, in both land and aquatic environments, plants and animals have moved to higher elevations at a median rate of 36 feet (0.011 kilometers) per decade and to higher latitudes at a median rate of 10.5 miles (16.9 kilometers) per decade. </dd>
	<dt> Food Web Disruptions </dt>
	<dd> The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms. </dd>
	<dt> Buffer and Threshold Effects </dt>
	<dd> Ecosystems can serve as natural buffers from extreme events such as wildfires, flooding and drought. Climate Change and human modification may restrict ecosytems' ability to temper the impacts of extreme conditions and thus may increase vulnerability to damage. </dd>
	<dt> Pathogens, Parasites and Disease </dt>
	<dd> Climate changed and shifts in ecological conditions could support the spread of pathogens, parasites and diseases, with potentially serious effects on human health, agriculture, and fisheries. </dd>
	<dt> Extinction Risks </dt>
	<dd> Climate change, along with habitat destruction and pollution, is one of the important stressors that can contribute to species extinction. </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Minor Effects on Our Ecosystem </h3>
<dl>
    <dt> Agricultural Effects on Our Ecosystem </dt>
    <dd> Agriculture practices having environmental impacts that affect a wide range of ecosystem services, including water quality, pollination, nutrient cycling, soil retention, carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. </dd>
	<dt> Coral Reefs Role in Ecosystem </dt>
	<dd> Ecological impacts of coral bleaching and related mortality: 
	    <ul>
		    <li> Bleached corals are likely to have reduced growth rates, decreased reproductive capacity, increased susceptibility to diseases and elevanted mortality rates. </li>
			<li> Changes in coral community compositon can occur when more susceptible species are killed by bleaching events. </li>
			<li> Changes in coral communities also affect the species that depend on them, such as the fish and invertebrates that rely on live coral for food, shelter, or recruitment habitat. Change in the abundance and compositon of reef fish assemblages may occur when corals die as a result of coral bleaching. </li>
			<li> Declines in genetic and species diversity may occur when corals die as a result of bleaching. </li>
		</ul>
	</dd>
    <dt> Desert Role in Ecosystem </dt>
    <dd> The desert is a harsh, dry environment, but plants and animals who have adapted to those conditions thrive in these ecosystems. From eagles to ants, there are a diverse range of plants and animals that live and interact with one another in deserts around the world. Like all ecosystems, the web of species interactions can be fragile, and species extinction can have a large effect. The identity of the organism that is lost and its role in the ecosystem determines how the food chain is affected. </dd>
</dl>
<h3> Conclusion </h3>
<p> As a conclusion, our ecosytems depend on fundamental environmental cycles such as the continuous circulation of water, carbon and other nutrients. Human activities not only can damage our ecosystem and but also protect our planet. Despite of destroying, we all should find out how to save our ecosystem.</p>
