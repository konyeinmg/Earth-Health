<h2>25 Ways You Can Stop Global Warming &amp; 5 BIG BENEFITS</h2>
<h4>Five steps you can take in your own car and driving habits</h4>
 <ul><li>Drive a fuel efficient car.</li>
      <p>Make sure your next car you is at least 35% more fuel efficient than your current one.If possible buy a hybrid,flex fuel
			or bio diesel car.</p>
	<li>Maintain your car.</li>
	<p>Keep tires properly inflated.Under-inflated tires decrease fuel economy by up to one mile per gallon.This will eliminate up to 250 lbs.
		a year of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and save hundreds of dollars in gasoline.</p>
	<li>Avoid high speeds.</li>
	<p> Reducing high speeds will cut down on fuel usage.Fuel efficiency decreases at speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour.While driving on the high 
	way, for example, reducing speed from 65mph to 60mph reduces fuel consumption by 10 percent.</p>
	<li>Drive smoothly and avoid jackrabbit starts</li>
	<p>Accelerating requires about twice as much gasoline as gradual starts.Take it slow before accelerating after a stop and coast to red lights instead of 
	braking.Avoiding unnessary speedups, slow downs and stops can save as much as two miles per gallon.</p>
	<li>Plan trips carefully.</li>
	<p>Cutting down on the time spent in the car is the easiest way to conserve fuel. To minimize diving time, experts recommend combining all your short trips and errands.
	When possible,use carpools, public transporation, bike ride or walk. If your family owns multiple cars use the most fuel efficient car whenever possible.
	Go marketing with a friend when possible.</p>
	</ul>
	
<h4>Five steps you can take in your own home</h4>
<ul><li>Turn down your hot water  heater and keep dryer lint pipe clean</li>
<p>Instead of heating hot water only to mix it with cold water to an acceptable temperature turn down the setting on the water heater.While you are it
   make sure that the water heater and hot water pipes are properly insulated. Also, wash laundry in cold or warm water instead of hot.Make sure the lint pipe
   from your dryer is clear.A clogged lint pipe will make your dryer inefficient! You will save natural gas and money by following this step.</p>
   <li>Use energy efficient light bulbs and appliances.</li>
   <p>Replacing five or six light bulbs that are used the most can decrease carbon dioxide emissions form power plants by about 700 lbs a year.
		You will save about $90 annually just from this act alone! Turn off all lights when you leave a room and by running your appliances on full loads only 
		and installing motion sensors on outdoor lights  that burn all night.Turn off unused apppliances.Unplugging will save over 1,000 lbs of carbondioxide 
		and $256 per year.High effiency appliances can save $100 in annual utility bills and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by about 500 lbs a year.</p>
	<li>Use air conditioning and heating effiently.</li>
	<p>About one-half of our electric consumption is used for cooling and heating.Installl UV film on windows that are exposed to sunlight.This will decrease the need
		for air conditioning and save electricity.Install an attic and ceiling fans.Install insulation and weather stripping to make sure that no air is escaping.
		By adjusting your thermostat down two degrees in winter and up two degrees in the summer, save 2,000 lbs of carbon dioxide and $98 per year. Clean or replace
		dirty air conditioner filters as recommended.Save 350 lbs. of carbon dioxide and $150 per year.</p>
	<li>Plant trees.</li>
	<p>Trees breathe in CO<sub>2</sub> and produce oxygen.If you live in an apartment, cultivate indoor plants or donate trees.</p>
	<li>Reduce and Recycle</li>
	<p>Reducing your garbage by 25 percent can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 1,000 pounds per year.Recycling aluminum cans, glass bottles,plastic,cardboard and newspapers 
	   can reduce your home's carbon dioxide emissions by an additional 850 pounds per year.</p>
	  </ul>
