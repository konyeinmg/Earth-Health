<div><b>The collection, distribution and treatment of drinking water and wastewater nationwide consume tremendous amounts of energy and approximately
	116 billion pounds of car <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> per year &mdash; as much global warming pollution each year as 10 million
	cars.The energy water connection is particularly strong  in the driest regions of the United States, such as the Southwest, where significant amounts energy
	are used to import water.Solutions exist to cut both water and energy use.Through water effiency measures, we can help to protect dry areas from droght,
	lower consumers' utility bills, and reduce global warming pollution.</b></div>

<h1>Reducing Global Warming Pollution Through Water Use Strategies</h1>
<div>Water conservation and effiency measures reduce the burden on these energy-intensive water systems.There are ways to cut down on energy use &mdash; and greenhouse gas emissions &mdash;at every stage in the water process.</div>

<li>Use Low Impact Development</li>
   <div>Capturing and reusing stromwater runoff can greatly reduce the consumption of imported, potable water, as well as the  energy use and <abbr title="carbon dioxide">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> 
   emissions associated with importing water. When runoff is diverted and captured before it flows into surface waters, it can be used onsite either to replenish groundwater supplies
   through infiltration or for graywater uses, like landscape irrigation and toilet flushing.These techniques are known as <abbr title="Low Impact Development">LID</abbr>.
   By using this method, the result is less water pollution from contaminated runoff, less flooding, replenished water supplies, and often   more natural-looking, aesthetically pleasing cityscapes.</div>
   
<li>Recycle and Reuse Wastewater</li>
<div>Because water suitable for reuse is often a by-product of existing secondary and teritiary wastewater treatment process, this type of water recycling is a low-energy source of water supply.
	Recycled water can be delivered to users, usually at less cost than non-recycled water, for anything from irrigating golf courses,parks and crops to mixing concrete to firefighting.
	In fact,OrangeCountry, California now uses advanced treatment bottled water quality, then allows it to percolate into the groundwater basin for later use as potable water.This system uses only about half the energy.</div>
	
<li>Fix Leaking Drinking Water Pipes</li>
	<div>Water treatment process use large quantities of energy to treat and distribute water to customers.Energy use for water treatment is expected to increse as more stringent water quality rules and improved disinfection technologies,
	such as  ultraviolet treatment and ozonation, are put in place that reduce the risk of carcinogens and other potentially harmful by products.
	Drinking water systems lose as much as 20percent of treated drinking water each year due to leaks in their pipe networks.Improving drinking water would
	save water and energy,reduce the global warming pollution that results from wasted energy.</div>
	
<li>Require and Provide Incentives for Agricultural Water-Use Effiency and Soil and Manure Management</li>
<div>Agriculture is a major user of groundwater and suface water in  the United States, accounting for about 85 percent of the country's consumptive water use.</div>
