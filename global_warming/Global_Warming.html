<h3>What is &quot;Global Warming&quot;?</h3>
<div style="text-indent:3em">Global Warming is a term often used interchangeably with the term &quot;Climate Change&quot;, but they are not entirely the same thing.Global Warming refers to an average increase in the temperature of atmosphere near Earth's surface.The gases in the atmosphere that prevent heat from leaving the 
	planet act like a &quot;<a href="greenhouse.html"><b>Green house</b></a>&quot; around the planet.Many scientists now believe that there is a direct link between this warming and emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen oxides(NO<sub>2</sub>) caused by human 
	activities.Global warming will not only be felt many decades from now &mdash;it is already happening and its impacts are clearly visible.</div><br>
<h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
<div style="text-indent:3em">&quot;Climate Change&quot; means our Earth&rsquo; weather is changing and it is harmful to the planet.Climate change refers to any substantial change in measures of climate(such as temperature or precipitation) lasting for
	 an extended period (decades or longer). Natural factors have caused the climate to change but human activities are the primary cause of the changes that are being observed now.Climate changing can also bring several other
	 problems such as </div>
	 <ul><li>Drying of surface water bodies</li>
		<li>Fall in ground water table</li>
		<li>serious water shortage</li>
		<li>Desertification of vast areas which were hitherto fertile and productive lands,crop pattern change </li>
		<li>reduced agricultural yields shortage of food,growth in micro-organisms and </li>
		<li>spread of diseases,etc</li></ul><br>
<h3>Are humans causing it?</h3>
<div style="text-indent:3em">Humans have been emitting extra greenhouse gases, which are the result of burning fossil fuels(like coal, oil and gas).In the next years, CO<sub>2</sub> produced by man will cause a lot more warming, from as low as three &deg; C to as high as 8 or 10 &deg; C.
