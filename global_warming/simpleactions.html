<div>The United States is the world's second-largest emitter of global warming pollution, currently 7 billion tons of greenhouse gases(GHGs) into the atmosphere every year.
	&quot;Carbon footprint&quot; that is more than 20 times larger than people living in many developing countries.If Americans adopted a series of 
	simple and inexpensive emissions-reducing measures in the areas of transporation, household energy consumption,diet, and waste over the next ten years,
	the U.S. could avoid 1 billion tons of emissions annually,beginning in 2020, and save money.
	<p>Behavioral change and personal action &mdash;in addition to responsible policymaking and technological innovation&mdash; are critical to any successful
	effort to curb greenhouse gas pollution and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.All of the recommendations offeered are cost-effective and ready to be adopted.
	They are simple and significant steps we can take to help protect our own health,our communities, and the planet.</p>
