<div >Greenhouse gases got their name because they trap heat(energy) like a greenhouse in the lower part of atmosphere.
	As more of these gases are added to atmosphere, more heat is trapped.This extra heat leads to higher air temperatures near Earth's surface,alters weather patterns, and raise the temperature of oceans.
	Green house gases are </div>
<ul>
<li>carbon dioxide(CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
<li> methane(CH<sub>4</sub>)</li>
<li> nitrous oxide </li>
<li> flurinated gases</li>
</ul>
<div>Water vapour is the most important greenhouse gas in the troposphere.Earth enjoys these extreme temperature because of its atmosphere, which is the thin layer of gases that cover and protect the planet.However, 
97% of climate scientists and researcher agree that humans have changed the Earth's atmosphere in dramatic ways over past two centuries, resulting in global warming.To understand global warming, it is first nessary to become familiar
with the greenhouse effect.By absorbing infra-red or heat radiation from the earth's surface, greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere, act aas blankets over the earth's surface, keeping it an average 20 or 30 degree cerius warmer than it would. This greenhouse effect has been known for nearly two hundred years.</div><br>
