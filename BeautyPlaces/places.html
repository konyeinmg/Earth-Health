<center><h1>10 places to visit now before they're ruined forever by global warming</h1></center>
<div style="text-indent: 3em"><b>Some of the world's best-known landmarks are in danger of being ruined by a rise in sea levels, higher temperatures and extreme weather events tied to climate change, according to the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Union of Concerned Citizens.
</div><br>
<i>Here are a few sites to visit carefully while they're still open to tourists.</i>
<table>
<tr>
   <td><img src="1.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Bwidi Impenetrable National Park,Uganda</figcaption></td>
   <td>The tropical forest in Uganda is home to just under half of the world's remaining endangered 880 mountain gorillas.
   Infact, the Democratic Republic of  the Congo, Rwanda and Uganda are the only three countries where tourists  can see those gorillas.
   UNESCO's report says warmer temperatures and deforestation have put the gorilla population in danger.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="2.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Cape Floral Protected Areas, South Africa</figcaption></td>
   <td>Tourist who love plants and gardens should consider a trip to the Cape Floral Protected Areas of South Africa, which includes the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, a site with 7,000 different garden and wild plant species.
   Hotter temperatures and an increse in large fires is putting the area at risk, UNESCO says.</td>
   
</tr>
<tr>
   <td><img src="3.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Ouadi Qadisha(the Holy Valley) and the Forest of the Cedars of God,Lebanon</figcaption></td>
   <td>UNESCO estimates climate change will continue to contribute to the trees' decline.An increasingly arid climate has led to more insect and moth attacks on the plants.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="4.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Rock Islands Southern Lagoon, Palau</figcaption></td>
   <td>Palau has a population of about 21,000 but had visits from 160,000 tourists in 2015 alone, mainly for scuba diving and snorkeling trips.
       Pollution, rising water temperatures and ocean acidification has damaged the corals and led to coral bleaching.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="5.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Komodo National Park, Indonesia</figcaption></td>
   <td>This national park in Indonesia is known for its many different ecosystems, from mangroves to coral reefs to dry savannah and tropical forests.
       But Ocean acidification and warming temperatures have damaged the islands' coral reefs(as in Palau), and rising sea levels have put mangrove forest at risk.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="10.jpg" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Ilulissat Icefjord, Greenland</figcaption></td>
   <td>Warmer temperatures have already increased tourism to the Ilullissat Icefjord; the fjord is usually frozen over the winter.
       The entire Greenland ice sheet could melt in the next 1,000 years, UNESCO'S report says.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="6.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Yellowstone National Park, United States</figcaption></td>
   <td>Higher annual temperatures have led to shorter winters at Yellowstone, which has led to less melted snow and lower water flows in the park's streams and rivers.
       The area has also seen its wetlands shrink and increased fires have led to destruction of forests.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="7.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Historic sites in Cartagena, Colombia</figcaption></td>
   <td>Many original buildings, including churches and military sites, can still be seen today in the city's historic center.
   Sites including the Fort of San Jose have already been significantly damaged by waves and erosion.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="8.png" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Venice and its lagoon, Italy</figcaption></td>
   <td>This national park in Indonesia is known for its many different ecosystems, from mangroves to coral reefs to dry savannah and tropical forests.
       But Ocean acidification and warming temperatures have damaged the islands' coral reefs(as in Palau), and rising sea levels have put mangrove forest at risk.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
   <td><img src="9.jpeg" width="200" height="170"><figcaption>Galapagos Islands, Ecuador</figcaption></td>
   <td>More than 205,000 people visited the islands in 2013, and tourism generates $418 million annually there.
   But climate change-related events such as the warm currrents of El Nino hava led to lower populations of many animals and caused bleaching on coral reefs.</td>
