<p style="text-indent: 3em">Dramatic riverbank erosion in Myanmar has washed away a Buddhist pagoda,amid heavy flooding across large parts of the
country that has displaced tens of thousands and caused two deaths.
Video provided to Reuters by a Buddhist monk near Pakokku,520 kilometers north of the commercial hub of Yangon,showed a gold-lef-covered pagoda slipping into the 
raging waters of the Ayeyarwady late last week.The abbott at the pagoda,U Pyinnya Linkkara,said flooding was common in the area during the monsoon that runs from
May to October,but this year's floods caused alarming erosion.Some riverside villages have been washed away
entirely. </p>
