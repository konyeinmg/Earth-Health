<h2> Observed Changes</h2>
<p> In Myanmar, the observed evidence of change over the last 60 years includes a nationwide increase n temperaure of on average around 0.08 degree Celsius per decade and an increase in total rainfall (29-215 millimetres per decade).
       Importantly, changes in the duration of the monsoon season gave been observed as well as the recurrence and severity of extreme weather events (NAPA 2012). </p>
<p> Examples of observed changes in climate related hazards in Myanmar 
       include, and their consequences include:</p>
<img class = "right" src = "9.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<h3> Increase in the prevalence of drought events: </h3>
<p> Drought years were frequent in the 1980s and the 1990s, and there was a severe drought in 2010.</p>
<h3>Increase in intensity and frequency of cyclones/strong winds:</h3>
<img class = "left" src = "12.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<p> From 1887 to 2005, 1,248 tropical storms formed in the Bay of Bengal. Eighty of these storms (6.4 percent of the total) reached Myanmar's coastline. Recent cyclones of note include Cyclone Mala (2006), Nargis (2008) and Giri (2010).
       Cyclone Nargis is hit the Ayeyarwady Delta in May 2008. It left 138,373 dead and affected a further 2.4 million people.</p>
<p> Cyclone Giri hit Rakhine State in October 2010, destroying 21,242 houses and affecting at least 224,212 people.</p>

<h3> Rainfall variability </h3>
<p> Over the period 1960-2009, there were shorter rainfall seasons in combination with erratic and intense rainfall resulted in numerous flooding events. From July to October in 2011, there was heavy rain and flooding in the Ayeyarwady,
       Bago, Mon and Rakhine Regions/States.</p><br><br>
<img class = "left" src = "3.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<h3>Increase in the occurrence of flooding and storm surge:</h3>
<p> From 1910 to 2000, 12 major floods occurred in the country. In June 2001, a severe flash flood occurred in the Wundwin Township in central Myanmar, which swept away a number of villages. In June 2010, intense rains resulted in excessive 
        sedimentation of paddy fields in Rakhine State. July and August 2015 flooding and landslides displaced 1.6 million people caused almost 120 deaths, and damaged agriculture and infrastructure.</p><br>

<h2> Sectoral Impacts for Myanmar</h2>
<p> The observed past, on-going and future changes have many consequences for all economic, productive, social and environmental sectors in Myanmar. For instance, the increased temperature is having a large impact on sectors such as 
        agriculture; in the Dry Zone for example, many people have been forced to migrate and find new sources of income as a result of changing rainfall patterns and pest infestations. The MCA Programme studied the perception of these hazards 
        in five states and regions, consultin 23 townships. More precisely, the impacts are either already observed or foreseeable if the projections for climated change are correct. Between 2001 and 2010, sea-level rise in coastal areas caused cultivated 
        lands inundated, and ground water contamination.</p><br>
<h2> Agriculture, Livestock and Food Security </h2>
<p> Myanmar's economy and society is still largely dependent on agriculture, which is mostly rain-fed. The changes in climate, therefore, have a heavy impact on this important sector. This may include Multiple sources, including NAPA 2012.</p>
<h3>Impact on Agricultural Output</h3>
<img class = "right" src = "5.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<p> Impacts can be categorized in three ways: impact on productivity of the current agricultural techniques and crops; sudden destruction of cultavations by severe hazards, or lack of production because of droughts; and erosion of soils in the long-term.
       Examples include: </p>
<ul>
<li>The rise in temperature in Myanmar is expected to have negative impacts on agricultural production and food security.</li>
<li>The highly productive deltaic and low-lying coastal rice cultivation areas will be exposed to increased salinity, coastal erosion and inundation.</li>
<li>An increase in extreme high temperatures is already creating problems in the Dry Zone, for example the severe drought in 2009, which impacted mahor cereal crops.</li>
<li>In 2010, severe drought diminished village water sources across the country and destroyed agricultural yields of peas, sugar cane, tomato, and rice.</li>
<li>From July to October 2011, heavy rain and flooding in the Ayeyawady, Bago, Mon and Rakhine Regions/States resulted in losses of approximately 1.7 million tons of rice.</li>
<li>The Zawgyi River floods in October 2006 caused extensive crop damage.</li>
<li>In 2007, extensive record-breaking flooding resulted inthe inundation of 809,284 hectares of cropland and more than 50 percent of crops wew damaged.</li>
<li>The excessive sedimentation in the Rakhine State in 2010 damaged rice seedlings and reduced harvests resulting in total damage of USD 1.64 million.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Impact on Fisheries</h3>
<p> Climate change has affected the coastal and marine environment, causing deterioration of mangroves, coral reefs and sea-grass beds, which are vital breeding and feeding grounds for fish. Cyclones cause loss of fishing vessels and impact offshore, 
       inshore and inland fisheries, causing high economic losses.</p>

<h2>Environment, Natural Resources and Biodiversity</h2>
<p> Myanmar is ecologically diverse: forest and ecosystem services benefit a range of socio-economic sectors and local livelihoods. The country is undergoing change on multiple fronts, with pressures arising from internal refroms, economic liberalization 
       and global trends, including climate change. From 1989-1998, the annual deforestation rate in Myanmar is estimated at 466,420 hectares per year. Over the past two decades, Myanmar has lost more than three percent of its forest ecosystems. 69.2
       percent of households use firewood as their main source of energy. Although mining has a tather small share of Myanmar's GDP (0.54 percent ) it is causing significant and increasing environmental damage in marine and coastal ecosystems.</p>
<p>The industry sector and coal production are going to expand. Climate change has a very heavy impact on the fragile eco-system balances. The services provided by the eco-system are vulnerable to changes in temperature, seasons and other effects of 
       global warming.</p>
<h3>Impact on Forests</h3>
<img class = "right" src = "8.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<p>Climate change is likely to affect both the distribution and composition of forests in Myanmar. Changes in temperature and precipitation levels, as well as extreme climate events haave caused forest die-back, conversion of forests to grasslands/steppes/deserts
       and increased the spread of invasive species/insect pests. The predicted increase in droughts and extreme temperatures will increase evapotranspiration from the canopy of trees, causing increased moisture stress. This will in turn increase th vulnerability of forests 
       to fire. The Dry Zone is experiencing intense heat and desertification, leading to loss of planet species.</p>
<h3>Impact on Water Resources</h3>
<p> The late onset and early withdrawal of the monsoon period will result in large quantities of rain falling over short periods, leading to flooding, contamination of water resources, erosion and limited replenishment of waterways. Salinization is also a threat in coastal areas.
        The progressive melting of glaciers may have an impact on the Himalayan region of Myanmar whch provides large quantities of water to many parts of Myanmar.</p>
<h3>Impact on Biodiversity</h3>
<img class = "left" src = "14.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<p> There is a shift in the range and migration patterns of species. There have been notable changes in the flowering and fruiting seasons/times of plant species. Climate change is likely to impact freshwater biodiversity. Increasing sea temperatures and changes to seawater chemical 
        composition affected marine biodiversity, particularly coral reef ecosystems.</p>
<h2> Energy, Industry and Transport</h2>
<p> According to NAPA the expected changes will increase the vulnerability of power generation as Myanmar has the second highest hydropoweer potential in Asia after India, and river systems will be significantly impacted by erratic rainfall and droughts. There is also a risk of erosion for
       dams that may result in life-threatening hazards if they collapse. Transport infrastructure may be affected by cyclones and floods.</p>
<p> Industrial production is heavily dependent on raw materials, energy consumption, water use. As these will be affected by changes in climate, the industrial sector may also suffer.</p>
<h2>Human Settlements and Cities</h2>
<img class = "right" src = "3.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<p>The concentration of assets and people in cities increases their vulnerability vis-a-vis severe climate related events. Flash floods, inundation, destruction of houses and basic infrastructure by tropical storms and cyclones. In coastal areas, small and large towns and villages are already suffering 
       from coastal erosion, increased risk of floods, storm-surges, salinization of water resources for drinking and peri-urban agriculture. Townships like Labutta, or Bogalay are an example of this vulnerability. Major cities like Yangon can also expect greater risk of flooding. Prices of food in cities may 
       also increase as a result of decreased prodution, with potential for conflict and socio-economic vulnerability of urban dwellers.</p><br><br>
<h2>Public Health</h2>
<img class = "left" src = "11.jpg" width = "320" height = "240">
<p> Increasing temperatures and erratic precipitation patterns will create favourable conditions for the spread of infectious diseases. Additional effects of increasing temperatures on human health include, inter alia, heat stress, heat exhaustion and dehydration. During summer 2010, 1,482 heat-related disorders
       were reported and 260 heat-related deaths occurred across Myanmar.</p>
<p> Higher temperatures will reduce the development time for pathogens and thereby increase transmission rates e.g. mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue will increase. Shan and Rakhine States are experiencing malaria outbreaks. An increase in non-potable fresh water sources will result in 
       communities without safe drinking water, increasing dehydration risks and further exacerbating diarrheal diseases.</p>
