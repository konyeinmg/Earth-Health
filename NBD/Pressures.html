<h2>Current and future pressures on biodiversity-a survey of the ecological community</h2>

	
	 	<div class="test">In December 2015, Ecological Society of Australia(ESA) members were surveyed to solicit opinions on the current and emerging pressures on biodiversity
		    , and impediments to effective management; 155 members responded A summary of the responses to these questions is given below.</div>
		   <h3> What are the 5 most significant threats facing biodiversity in 2015?</h3>
			<div class="test">Clearing and land-use change was the most common reponse, and rated as the most important significant threat.(i.e. ranked first in 56 percent of responses).furthermore, clearing and land-use change was given as one of the top 5 significant threats by 94 percent of respondents.Climate change was
			most commonly given as the next most important threat, with 76 percent of respondents rating climate change as one of the top 5 significant
			threats, invasive species and pathogens were next 69 percent of respondents rated invasive species and pathogens as one of the top 5 
			significant threats.Respondents also identified a range of govenance and social issues as a threat to biodiversity, including issues
			as a threat to biodiversity, including issues relating to low resourcing of land management actions,agencies and research; poor
			public education and lack of empathy for biodiversity.(Table <abbr title="Biodiversity1">BIO1</abbr>)</div><br>

<h3>What are the top 5 emerging issues with the potential to have serious outcomes for biodiversity in the next 10 years?</h3>
	<div class="test">Climate change was ranked as the most important emerging threat in 44 percent of respones, and 73 percent of respondents noted climate change as one of the top 5 emerging issues.
Clearing and habitat modification, and governance issues were the next 2 most important emerging issues;53 percent noted clearing and habitat modification, and 49 percent noted biosecurity in
the top 5 emerging issues.Most of the respones in the governance issues category referred to a range of poor or indequate government policy and effective legislation, and a lack of adequate protection
and management in reserves-thiswas often realted to a lack of resourcing for areas in the conservation estate and for natural resource management managers.
Mining and development as an emerging risk was noted by 34 percent of respondents.Many reffered to the expansion of mining and development generally;some specifically referred to development
in northern Australia or to coal-seam gas.Overall, most of the respones related to escalation of existing pressures, rather than emerging pressures(Tabel <abbr title="Biodiversity2"> BIO2 </abbr> ).</div><br>
