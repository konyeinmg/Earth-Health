	<li><b>Help Native Pollinators.</b></li><p id="latter">
		Pollinators are the key to reproduction for most flowering plants which are foundational to the survival of many species on our planet.
		This is why the criteria of Biodiversity Hotspots gives so much weight to the number of plants in an area.Give pollinator an extra
		boost in your backyard by:reducing or eliminating the use of pesticides, providing nectar sources by planting a variety of wildflowers and 
		native plants that will bloom throughtout the season, leaving logs and rocks in your City to stop weed-whacking median strips and sidewalk 
		edges and let native wildflowers grow to create pollinator corridors.Visit the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation to learn more.</p><br>
	<li><b>Reduce or eliminate pesticides and fertilizer.</b></li><p id="latter">
		Consider getting rid of your lawn, especially if you live in an arid region.Instead, plant native plants that are well adapted to your area.
		This will reduce the need to use pesticides and fertilizers.Don't buy plants from nurseries that use systemic pesticides such as neonictinoids.
		When applied, they persist in all parts of the plant from the seed to the stem to the blossom and reek havoc on already stressed pollinators.
		Use organic compost and soil additives instead.Soil health is the best prevention for pest infestations, but if you do get visited by unwanted
		guests,learn how to care for your plants with organic pest control.</p><br>
	<li><b>Restore habitat in your yard.</b></li><p id="latter">
		If you have a yard, consider turning it into a mini-wildlife sanctuaryl.<i>National Wildlife Federation</i> has a program to help you attract
		wildlife whether you have a balcony or a 20-acre farm.In a world where habitat loss is the number one cause of biodiversity loss,providing 
		wildlife with water,food,cover,and a place to raise their young can go a long way.</p><br>
	<li><b>Restore habitat in your community.</b></li><p id="latter">
		If you don't have a yard, consider volunteering on an ecological restoration project in your area.Good places to look for volunteer opportunities
		are land trusts, wildlife foundations,Native Plant Societies, government agencies(e.g. Forest Service,Fish &amp; Wildlife), and
		environmental organizations.You'll spend time outdoors and learn about the native plants and animals.</p><br>
	<li><b>Reduce your consumption.</b><br><p id="latter">
		This is arguably the action that will have the biggest positive impact on the environment.The more we reduce our demand for new resources,
		or the energy to make those products, and the less waste goes into the landfill.The minimalist lifestyle also greatly benefits the environment.</p></li><br>
	<li><b>Reuse and recycle.</b></li><p id="latter">
		Composting is key here.It reduces the amount of waste going into landfills and the space needed to hold that waste.Look into ways you can
		use those purchases intended for single-use.Keep up with what is recyclable in your area.As new markets for recycled products open up,
		even small towns like mine can increase the numbers of items that they are able to collect.</p><br>
	<li><b>Reduce your energy demand.</b></li><p id="latter">
		Burning fossil fuels is the number one driver of climate change which is exponentially quickening biodiversity loss by presenting unparalleled
		challenges to the world's plants and animals.Start by conserving energy in your home.A Home Energy Audit can help raise your awareness about
		where you can reduce energy use in your home.Then incoroporate renewable energy,Solar.</p><br>
	<li><b>Buy local foods.</b></li><p id="latter">
		Buying from your local farmer at a farmer's market or through a farm stand gives you the ability to find out how your food was grown and make
		requests for different practices such as no pesticides, or a greater diversity of produce.It's easier to ask someone you have a relationship
		with to change their practices than a big corporation.</p><br>
	<li><b>Buy organic foods.</b></li><p id="latter">
		While organic certification doesn't guarantee that your food is 100% free of pesticides, organic growers are held to criteria of minimal
		pesticide use.</p><br>
	<li><b>Donate to conservation efforts.</b></li><p id="latter">
		Species extinction is happpening at an unprecedented rate and there never seems to be enough money to save everything Prioritze your
		charitable giving to support conservation efforts in the world's biodiversity hotspots.</p><br>
	<li><b>Advocate for Biodiversity.</b></li>
		<ul type="square">
			<li>Educate yourself about the importance of biodiversity and be able to answer the questions,"Why does it matter so much?" and 
				"Why should we male sacrifices to protect it?"</li>
			<li>Genetically modified crops pose multiple serious threats to biodiversity.Support the International Union of Concerned Scientists
				recommendations on GM crops.</li>
			<li>Make connections.Get to know wildlife and conservation biologists as well as political activists and community leaders in your
				area.Use social media to connect with experts and campaigns.</li>
			<li>Lobby your goverment.Sign or create petitions.Support politicians who support measrues to protect biodiversity.</li>
			<li>Share your message.Talk to your friends in preson.Use social media.Start a biog.Speak at local events.</li>
