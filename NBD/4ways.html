	<li><b>Putting Things Right</b></li><p id="latter">
		Unfortunately, human activity has harmed the world's biodiversity.Too much fishing and hunting, desturction and damage to habitats,
		pollution,climate change: all these threaten biodiversity.Fortunately, some damage can be reversed through restoration of an area's
		habitat.Restoring a habitat provides the foundation for biodiversity.The species that should be living in an area can return or increase
		in numbers.Even in urban areas, restoring native plants can provide food and shelter for native animal and insect species.In such areas,
		establishing wildlife corridors allows animals to travel safely.</p><br>
	<li><b>Practicing Sustainability</b></li><p id="latter">
		Human activity is reducing biodiversity at a rate 1,000 times faster than has happened over the last 65 million year, according to the
		the International Union for Conservatin of Nature.The Earth can't sustain biodiversity under such conditions.The <abbr title="International Union for Conservatin of Nature">
		IUCN </abbr>predicts the extinction of over a million species in the next  half-century.Practicing sustainablity means using resources more
		wisely so that Earth can maintain its riches.For instance, anyone can buy organic product, which reduces habitat damage by eliminating
		harmful pesticides and fretilizer.Energy efficient products consume less energy and also protect resources.</p><br>
	<li><b>Keeping Things Wild</b></li><p id="latter">
		About 45 percent of the world's forests are gone, according to the United Nations,yet they contain most of land's biodiversity.By
		destroying all this habitat, human activity is causing the worst extinction event since the extinction of the dinosaurs.Setting 
		aside remaining wild areas not only preserves existing biodiversity, it also helps with efforts to restore ecosystems.The wild
		areas serve as  a reference point for how the environment of a given area should function Meanwhile,conserving forests prevent
		$3.7 trillion-worth of harmful greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2010 report from the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p><br>
	<li><b>Linking Ecology To Economy</b></li><p id="latter">
		For those who love nature for nature's sake, protecting biodiversity is an obivious priority.Those less concerned may need education
		that shows how biodiversity is linked to human welfare and wealth.Medicine, food, building material, clothing:these depend on Earth's
		biodiversity.Indeed, civilization itself is built on Earth's riches:its natural capital:and its loss costs money.Doing nothing to
		counteract biodiversity loss over the next 50 years will cost $2 to $4.5 trillion annually, the <abbr title="Convention on Biological Diversity">
		CBD </abbr>report warns.</p>
