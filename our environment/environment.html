<h1> Our Environment </h1>
<p> Our University is situated in Mandalay division, Pyin-Oo-Lwin, Pyin-Sar village. So we should take care of our environment from natural factors such as landslides, deforestation etc.</p>
<p> A landslide is the movement of rock, debris or earth down a slope. They result form the failure of the materials which mark up the hill slope and are driven by the force of gravity. Landslides are known 
       also as landslide, slumps or slope failure. Landslides occur when large amounts of wet debris, including rocks, earth, and trees, slide down a slope. They may occur as a result of fires, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions,
       storms, or human activity. So we must take care of our environment by avoiding landslides. </p>
<p> Deforestation, clearance or clearing is the removal of a forest or stand of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use. Examples of deforestation include conversion of forestland to farms, ranches, or 
       urban use. The most concentrated deforestation occurs in tropical rainforests. So we should save the forests around our environment by doing the following.</p>
<ul>
<li> Plant a tree.</li>
<li> Go paperless.</li>
<li> Recycle and buy recycled products.</li>
<li> Look for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification on wood and wood products.</li>
<li> Eat vegetarian meals as often as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p> The following photos are the beautiful places of our environment and we should save those places from landslides and deforestation as much as we can.</p>
