<h2>What is "Air Pollution" ?</h2>
<p>Air pollution is one of the most important environmental problems.At the same time, it is a complex problem posing multuple challenges in term of manangement and migation of harmful pollutants.Air pollutants are emitted from anthropogenic and natural sources; they may be either emitted directly or formed in the atmosphere.They have a number of impacts on health , ecosystem , the built environmemt and the climate ; they may be transported or formed over long distances ; and they may affect large areas.
Around 6.5 millions daeths are attributed each year to poor air quality , making this the world's fourth-largest threat to human health , behind high blood pressure , dietary risks ang smoking.</p>

		<dd>Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk.Heart diseases and stroke are the most common reasons for permature death attributable to air pollution and are responsible for 80% of causes of permature death;lung diseases and lung cancer.<br>
		Emerging literature shows that air pollution has been associated with health impacts on fertillity, pregnancy , and new-borns and children.These include negative effects on neural development and cognitive capacities , which in turn can affect performance at school and later in life , leading to lower productivity and quality of life.<br>
		While air pollution is harmful to all populations, some people suffer more because they live in polluted areas and are exposed to higher levels of airpollution, or they are more vulnerable to the health problems caused by air pollution.</dd><br>
