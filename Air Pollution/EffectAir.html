		<dd>Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk.Heart diseases and stroke are the most common reasons for permature death attributable to air pollution and are responsible for 80% of causes of permature death;lung diseases and lung cancer.<br>
		Emerging literature shows that air pollution has been associated with health impacts on fertillity, pregnancy , and new-borns and children.These include negative effects on neural development and cognitive capacities , which in turn can affect performance at school and later in life , leading to lower productivity and quality of life.<br>
		While air pollution is harmful to all populations, some people suffer more because they live in polluted areas and are exposed to higher levels of airpollution, or they are more vulnerable to the health problems caused by air pollution.</dd><br>

		<dd>Air pollution has several important envrronmental impacts and may directly affect vegetation, as well as the quality of water and soil and the ecosystem services that they support.For example ,ground level ozone(O<sub>2</sub>) damages argricultural crops , forests and plants by reducing their growth rates.</dd><br>

		<dt style="font-size:30px"><b>Climate Change</b></dt>
		<dd>Air Pollution and Climate Change are interwined.Several air pollutants are also climate forcers , which have a potential impact on climate and global warming in the short term(i.e decades).In addition, changes in weather patterns due to climate change may change the transport, dispersion , deposition , and formation of air pollutants in the atmosphere.For example ,a warmer climate leads to an increase in ground-level O<sub>2</sub> production and increased O<sub>2</sub> levels than contribute to more warming.

		<dd>Air pollution can also damage materials and buildings.The impact of air pollution on cultural heritage materials is a serious concern because it can lead to the loss of parts of our history and culture.Damage includes corrosion  , biogegradation and soiling.Emission of air pollutants can be deposited and build up over the years on the surfaces of buildings.
